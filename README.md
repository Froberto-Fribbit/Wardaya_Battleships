# Wardaya_Battleships
Makin' me a battleship game for my school project using the python curses library. 

Red = Player 1

Blue = Player 2

This code has been made to be, as much as possible, unbreakable (assuming you don't press something special like terminal commands so please don't).
So if you click where you should press or press where you should click or go out of bounds or whatever, it'll be fine :P.
All instructions to play the game is in there, so you'd have no trouble.
NOTE:
Do not cheat during ship placement phase
Get all enemy ships to win!

Enjoy :D
